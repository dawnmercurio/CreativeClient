# CreativeClient


This is an exercise to generate Creative Client scenarios for graphic design and advertising students.
It can be used simply as a brainstorming exercise to weigh the considerations and process involved for a Client, campaign and/or Communication type. It can also be used when a creative student is feeling stumped by the hurdle of not having enough restrictions in their creative challenge.

Always looking for feedback or contributions for other good client, campaign, or communication types.
